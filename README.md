# Health Care Prediction Website using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Health Care Prediction System** is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts various diseases based on medical input parameters. This platform is designed to aid in the early detection of serious conditions like heart attack, lung cancer, diabetes, breast cancer, and chronic diseases by leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms. It empowers users—patients or healthcare professionals—to make informed decisions through accurate, data-driven predictions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a web-based health prediction tool.
- Integrate multiple machine learning models for disease classification.
- Enable early diagnosis to support preventive healthcare.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for accessible use.

---

## 💡 Features

- Predicts five major diseases using medical input.
- Interactive web interface built with Flask and HTML/CSS.
- Multiple ML algorithms: SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
- Compares model performance and selects the most accurate one.
- Visual representation of predictions and metrics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Deployment Tools**: GitHub

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

### Publicly available datasets for:

- **Heart Disease**

- **Diabetes**

- **Breast Cancer**

- **Chronic Kidney Disease**

- **Lung Cancer**

- **Brain Stroke**

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models

The system supports and compares the performance of:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

Each model is trained and evaluated using real-world medical datasets, and the best-performing model is selected for deployment.

---

## 🧭 Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Expand prediction scope to more diseases
- Add user registration/login and health history tracking
- Deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure) for production use
- Mobile app version using React Native or Flutter
